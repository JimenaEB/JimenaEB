# Greetings  ðŸ––
I am a happy and proud woman to have become an engineer, so I love technical challenges.

At one point in my life, my environment pushes me towards design, UI and UX. I learned a lot, but my passion is code, and I enjoy designing architecture.

One of my strengths is communication, so I have been a web development teacher for people seeking a career change. I also mentor anyone who needs help, and I actively participate in the community either as a speaker, organizing events or as an active member of Python Spain and PyLadies.

I have several publications in media talking about the importance of learning to code and the need for diversity in the industry.

If I had to summarize my role in one sentence, it would be "Full Stack developer working on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from a technical perspective and happy to be part of the community".
